- I will defend my tribe to the death.
- Every serious choice I make must be decided by signs or omens from the gods.
- I carry the teeth of a great warrior. They inspire me to commit great deeds in battle.
- "To avenge Gruumsh, I will kill every elf I see."
- I will seek and destroy those who murdered my tribe.
- I owe my survival to a non-orc.
