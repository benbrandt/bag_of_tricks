- I have a calm temperament and let insults roll off my back.
- "I don't fear the gods and have no patience for superstitions."
- "I am slow to anger, but when I do become enraged I fight until my enemies are dead, no matter the cost."
- I understand the value of civilization and the order that society brings.
- "I don't trust anyone."
- I believe in living to fight another day.
