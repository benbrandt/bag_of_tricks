- My eloquent flattery makes everyone I talk to feel like the most wonderful and important person in the world.
- The common folk love me for my kindness and generosity.
- No one could doubt by looking at my regal bearing that I am a cut above the unwashed masses.
- I take great pains to always look my best and follow the latest fashions.
- "I don't like to get my hands dirty, and I won't be caught dead in unsuitable accommodations."
- "Despite my noble birth, I do not place myself above other folk. We all have the same blood."
- "My favor, once lost, is lost forever."
- "If you do me an injury, I will crush you, ruin your name, and salt your fields."
