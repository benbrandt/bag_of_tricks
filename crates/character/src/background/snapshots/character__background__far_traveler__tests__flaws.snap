- I am secretly (or not so secretly) convinced of the superiority of my own culture over that of this foreign land.
- I pretend not to understand the local language in order to avoid interactions I would rather not have.
- I have a weakness for the new intoxicants and other pleasures of this land.
- "I don't take kindly to some of the actions and motivations of the people of this land, because these folk are different from me."
- "I consider the adherents of other gods to be deluded innocents at best, or ignorant fools at worst."
- I have a weakness for the exotic beauty of the people of these lands.
