- "My family, clan, or tribe is the most important thing in my life, even when they are far from me."
- An injury to the unspoiled wilderness of my home is an injury to me.
- I will bring terrible wrath down on the evildoers who destroyed my homeland.
- "I am the last of my tribe, and it is up to me to ensure their names enter legend."
- I suffer awful visions of a coming disaster and will do anything to prevent it.
- It is my duty to provide children to sustain my tribe.
