- "I'm driven by a wanderlust that led me away from home."
- I watch over my friends as if they were a litter of newborn pups.
- "I once ran twenty-five miles without stopping to warn to my clan of an approaching orc horde. I'd do it again if I had to."
- "I have a lesson for every situation, drawn from observing nature."
- "I place no stock in wealthy or well-mannered folk. Money and manners won't save you from a hungry owlbear."
- "I'm always picking things up, absently fiddling with them, and sometimes accidentally breaking them."
- I feel far more comfortable around animals than people.
- "I was, in fact, raised by wolves."
