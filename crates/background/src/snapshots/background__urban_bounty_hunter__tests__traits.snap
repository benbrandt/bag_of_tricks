- I always have a plan for what to do when things go wrong.
- "I am always calm, no matter what the situation. I never raise my voice or let my emotions control me."
- The first thing I do in a new place is note the locations of everything valuable â€” or where such things could be hidden.
- I would rather make a new friend than a new enemy.
- I am incredibly slow to trust. Those who seem the fairest often have the most to hide.
- "I don't pay attention to the risks in a situation. Never tell me the odds."
- "The best way to get me to do something is to tell me I can't do it."
- I blow up at the slightest insult.
