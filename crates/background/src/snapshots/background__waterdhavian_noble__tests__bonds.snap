- I will face any challenge to win the approval of my family.
- "My house's alliance with another noble family must be sustained at all costs."
- Nothing is more important than the other members of my family.
- I am in love with the heir of a family that my family despises.
- My loyalty to my sovereign is unwavering.
- The common folk must see me as a hero of the people.
