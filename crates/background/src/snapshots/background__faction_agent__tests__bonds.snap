- I would die to recover an ancient relic of my faction that was lost long ago.
- I will someday get revenge on the corrupt faction hierarchy who branded me a traitor.
- I owe my life to the faction member who took me in when my parents died.
- Everything I do is for the common people.
- I will do anything to protect the network where I served.
- I seek to preserve a secret text that my enemies consider heretical and seek to destroy.
