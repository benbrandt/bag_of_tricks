- The workshop where I learned my trade is the most important place in the world to me.
- "I created a great work for someone, and then found them unworthy to receive it. I'm still looking for someone worthy."
- I owe my clan a great debt for forging me into the person I am today.
- "I pursue wealth to secure someone's love."
- One day I will return to my clan and prove that I am the greatest artisan of them all.
- I will get revenge on the evil forces that destroyed my place of business and ruined my livelihood.
