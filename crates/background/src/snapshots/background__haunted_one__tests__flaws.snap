- I have certain rituals that I must follow every day. I can never break them.
- I assume the worst in people.
- I feel no compassion for the dead. Theyâ€™re the lucky ones.
- I have an addiction.
- I am a purveyor of doom and gloom who lives in a world without hope.
- I talk to spirits that no one else can see.
