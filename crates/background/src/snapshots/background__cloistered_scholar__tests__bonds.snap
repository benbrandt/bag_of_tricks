- It is my duty to protect my students.
- I have an ancient text that holds terrible secrets that must not fall into the wrong hands.
- "I work to preserve a library, university, scriptorium, or monastery."
- "My life's work is a series of tomes related to a specific field of lore."
- "I've been searching my whole life for the answer to a certain question."
- I sold my soul for knowledge. I hope to do great deeds and win it back.
